# Better Testing For Developers

You a developer? Then you're a tester too, even if you don't realize it. This is a talk I've been giving to help developers test better. It presents three specific techniques that, once employed, will immediataly improve your testing. As a bonus, it also explains an important test automation problem that most developers overlook, and shows how to use GitHub to support the techniques presented.
